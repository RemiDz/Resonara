Now build the Room Discovery UI flow. Create the discovery page at src/app/(discover)/page.tsx with a full-screen stepper component that guides through 4 steps: AmbientListen, ClapTest, SpatialWalk, and InstrumentProfiler. Start with Step 1 (AmbientListen) and Step 2 (ClapTest) as fully functional components wired to the audio hooks. The opening screen should show a living mandala visualisation responding to ambient mic input with the prompt "Let's discover your space." Use Canvas 2D for the mandala. Follow the CLAUDE.md design language — dark cosmic background, gold accents, glass morphism panels. Mobile-first layout. Step 1 should auto-listen for 15 seconds, compute a Silence Quality Score (0-100) from the noise floor, and display the result. Step 2 should detect a clap impulse (sharp transient above threshold), capture the decay, run RT60 estimation, and present Sound Holding, Clarity, and Warmth in practitioner-friendly language. Include smooth transitions between steps.
